# Everything I know is wrong.

I don't know anything. Everything that I knew about C or C++ is outdated.

I have been studying this language since  was in the 9th grade. But till only 
recently I knew how to use multiple source files and compile them manually.

The way that I was taught C and C++ is wrong. This should change in the near future.
