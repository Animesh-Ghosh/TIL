## Usage

To auto-generate the README.md file, you can run
    ./createtil.py > README.md

If you are using git, you can install this script as a pre-commit git hook so
that it is autogenerated on each commit.  Use the following command:
    cd .git/hooks/ && ln -s ../../createtil.py pre-commit && cd -

The `.vimrc` file for this project contains a function `CountTILs` that can
be invoked with `<leader>c`. This will do a substitution count of the
current number of TILs and display the result in the command tray.

## About

I shamelessly stole this idea from
[thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til).
