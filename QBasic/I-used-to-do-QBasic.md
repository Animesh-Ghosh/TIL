# I used to do QBasic.

I found an old notebook in which I used to make notes for Computers in 9th standard. Lo and behold there were notes for QBasic. Will be creating a repository to hold my old notes.

```QBASIC
	REM Hello World
	CLS
	PRINT "Hello World"
	END
```

Yeah... GitHub won't highlight the keywords. And it detects ``.bas`` files as Visual Basic. But I guess it's close enough.
