# Makefiles exist.

For compiled languages like C or C++ the process of running the program includes
the following steps:

1. Preprocessing
2. Compiling
3. Assembling
4. Linking

You can either compile your files in one go or either compile all the individual files
separately and then link them all together (which is what is usually done).

Makefiles are used to automate this process. You can then build your whole program
by running a single command in the console.
