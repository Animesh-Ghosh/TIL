## Usage

Steps to follow : 

1. Create directories for specific topics for example if you solve a problem on *HackerRank* create 
   a directory named `Competitive Programming` or if you learned something new in JavaScript , create a 
   directory for the same .
   Some recommended categories :
    - Data Structures & Algo
    - Meetups
    - C++/JavaScript/Python
    - HTML/CSS
    - Git/Version Control
    - Machine Learning

2. Inside those directories create a [`Markdown`](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) file with your title for example 
    `Variables_in_JavaScript.md`, `Create_React_App.md` etc.
3. Run `python createtil.py > README.md` to auto-generate the New README file for you 
    OR
   If you are using git, you can install this script as a pre-commit git hook so
    that it is autogenerated on each commit.  Use the following command:
    `cd .git/hooks/ && ln -s ../../createtil.py pre-commit && cd -`
 
4. Once satisfied push your changes.
